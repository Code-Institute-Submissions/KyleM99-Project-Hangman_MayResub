# Hangman-Project
## Game of Hangman.

### My goal for this project is to create a game of hangman. 

## Design
Well there really isnt much new or revolutionary about the design of hangman, so hopefully it will look the same as every other one..
                    <br>
                    O
                  \\|/
                    |
                   / \\
                   <br>


## Bug Testing[if needed]
Had the lives set one too high for the hangman visuals. So putting it back to match the amount of visuals fixed that issue
<br>
Currently having a issue with deployment.

Fixed all of the deployment issues. Wasn't deploying due to a couple syntax errors left in the main code.
